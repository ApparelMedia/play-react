# Play with react

This Project is meant to be a starting point for us to get familiar with React.

Much of this project was generated with the [Create React App CLI](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).  This means that you can utilized all the features outlined in the link.

I've also added a few more nice features to quickly create React components:

## [Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/)
Storybook is an awesome tool to help you isolate your react components so you can develop/style it as a singular component

To add stories, see `stories/index.js`

## [Plop](https://github.com/amwmedia/plop)
`plop` lets you quickly generate whatever files you want.
To use, simply type `plop` and follow the prompt
